# goProject

## This is a project I am currently building in order to expand my knowledege in a few different areas. The project utilizes Go, shell scripting, and docker.

### The project is a simple container orchestration system that allows a user to work efficiently with docker container by allowing them to store the containers into "packets".

### In order to run the program in its current state, docker and go (1.16.0 or later) need to be installed. In the "goProject" repository, run "go run .", and to run either of the current shell scripts, run ./runPacket.sh or ./stopPacket.sh
